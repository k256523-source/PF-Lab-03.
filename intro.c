A C program follows a rigid, top-down structure that begins with preprocessor directives (like #include <stdio.h>) to load essential libraries, followed by the int main() function,  
which serves as the mandatory entry point for execution. Inside this function, all instructions are wrapped in curly braces { } and must end with a semicolon ; to signal the completion of a statement. 
The process typically concludes with a return 0; statement, which tells the operating system that the program ran successfully.
